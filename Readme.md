# Lung Cancer Analysis (Capstone Project)

•Created a cancer analysis project with CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) algorithm for lung cancer detection having 81% accuracy.

•The project allows users to upload cancer reports, and the integrated CNN model predicts whether the report indicates lung cancer or not with high accuracy.

•Conducted extensive data preprocessing on medical images to enhance model accuracy by 20%, including image normalization and augmentation techniques.

•Integrated the frontend interface with a Python Flask server to handle backend processing and facilitate communication with the CNN model.

•Designed Tableau dashboards with interactive features such as filters, drill-down capabilities, and tooltips, allowing stakeholders to explore cancer data dynamically and gain deeper insights into trends and patterns.
